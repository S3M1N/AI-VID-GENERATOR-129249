Viche, a strong and sweet liquor from Colombia, is on the rise, much like mezcal in Mexico. This ancestral drink, made from four types of sugarcane, is deeply rooted in Afro-Colombian culture, used in rituals from birth to death. Despite its growing popularity, viche faces challenges with cultural appropriation and legal restrictions. Bartenders are smuggling it overseas, highlighting its demand. The recent Law of Viche aims to protect this heritage, but regulatory hurdles remain. As viche gains recognition, the fight to preserve its cultural significance continues.
