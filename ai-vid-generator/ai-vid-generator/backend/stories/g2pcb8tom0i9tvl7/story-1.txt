F1 racer Pierre Gasly loves living in fashion-forward Milan. Here are his top weekend picks, from shopping in Quadrilatero della moda to walking his puppy in Parco Sempione. For Gasly, a pilot for the BWT Alpine F1 team, everyday life is as fast-paced as a lap on the circuit. So a great home base is especially important. That's why, in 2019, Gasly settled in Milan, Italy's stylish financial capital. He loves the city's combination of fashion, food, and Formula One culture.
