The rise in Rupert's net worth was buoyed by strong performances in the luxury goods sector. As well as the Switzerland-based Richemont, his other holdings include Remgro, a South African investment vehicle with stakes in more than 30 companies. He inherited the family business from his father, Anton Rupert, and has expanded it from mostly tobacco to become a multi-billion-dollar luxury goods venture. The billionaire lives in Cape Town, where he owns a lavish mansion, but he also has properties in Geneva and London.
