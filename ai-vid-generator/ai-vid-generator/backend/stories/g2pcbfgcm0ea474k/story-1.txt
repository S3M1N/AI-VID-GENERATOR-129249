New Mexico's green chile cheeseburger (GCCB) is a beloved state food, with each eatery claiming the best version. Hatch, the chile capital, is famous for its unique chiles. The GCCB likely originated at The Owl Bar & Café in San Antonio, near the Manhattan Project site. The dish became popular among scientists there. Today, many places in New Mexico offer their own takes on the GCCB, celebrated on the Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Key spots include Sparky’s Burgers, Buckhorn Tavern, and Mineshaft Tavern, each adding their unique twist to this iconic burger.
