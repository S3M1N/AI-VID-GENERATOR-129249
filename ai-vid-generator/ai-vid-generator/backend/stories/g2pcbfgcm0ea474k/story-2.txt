Hatch, New Mexico, is renowned for its green chiles, celebrated every August at the Hatch Chile Festival. The unique terroir of the Rio Grande River valley gives these chiles their distinct flavor and heat. The GCCB, featuring these chiles, is a staple in New Mexico's culinary scene. The Owl Bar & Caf√© in San Antonio is credited with creating the first GCCB, a favorite among Manhattan Project scientists. Today, the Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail highlights the best spots to enjoy this iconic dish, with each location offering its own unique twist.
