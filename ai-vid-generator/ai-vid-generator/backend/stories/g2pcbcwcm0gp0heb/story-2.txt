Viche's production is predominantly a female tradition, with women known as vicheras leading the way. They craft the liquor using traditional methods, infusing it with local herbs for medicinal purposes. Each batch of viche is unique, influenced by the terroir where the sugarcane is grown. The drink has gained traction among chefs and mixologists, becoming a trendy choice in urban areas. However, the lack of formal recognition and regulation poses a threat to its authenticity and the livelihoods of its producers.
