The Petronio √Ålvarez Pacific Music Festival has played a crucial role in promoting viche, allowing it to reach a wider audience. Despite its cultural significance, the drink has faced historical bans and ongoing legal challenges. The recent law aims to safeguard viche's production by Afro-Colombians, but implementation remains slow. As the demand for viche grows, the community is determined to protect their heritage and ensure that the benefits of this ancestral drink remain within their culture.
