Viche is made from four types of sugarcane and can have an alcohol content between 31% and 51%. Women, known as vicheras, play a significant role in its production. The drink is infused with potent herbs to create medicinal beverages. Viche's unique flavor varies based on the terroir where the cane grows. The drink is gaining popularity in Colombia's cities, but legal and cultural challenges remain.
