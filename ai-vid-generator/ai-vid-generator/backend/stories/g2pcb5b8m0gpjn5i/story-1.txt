Viche, a strong and sweet liquor, is on the verge of becoming Colombia's national alcohol. Afro-Colombians have been producing it for centuries from sugarcane. The drink is deeply rooted in their culture, used in rituals from birth to death. Despite its growing popularity, viche faces challenges like legal restrictions and cultural appropriation. Efforts are underway to protect its heritage and promote it globally.
