Nine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, offers a unique sleep experience with its '9h sleep fitscan' service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report. The white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods resemble a science-fiction movie set. The hotel's concept reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Hourly rates are also available for those who just need a nap.
