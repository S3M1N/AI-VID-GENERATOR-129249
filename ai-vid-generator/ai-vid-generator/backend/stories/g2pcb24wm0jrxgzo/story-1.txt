From Colombia's upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky in Canada, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers.

The capsules, predominantly single-occupancy, also cater to the boom in solo travel. With the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged, tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in Colombia to space-age pods in Sydney.
