The Tubo Hotel in Colombia's Tatacoa desert offers tiny, air-conditioned rooms fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours. The 37 capsules provide just enough room for a double bed, with almost half having a shared bathroom. The hotel features a shared swimming pool, shady garden, bar, and restaurant. The Free Spirit Spheres on Vancouver Island, Canada, offer a unique experience suspended among the conifers. The spheres, based on the principle of biomimicry, are accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree and are available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C.
