As natural disasters like wildfires and storms intensify, travelers must consider key questions before visiting affected areas. Is your visit helping the local community? Are you contributing positively or just observing? Listen to locals and respect their recovery efforts. Support local businesses and be mindful of the community's needs. Tourism can aid recovery, but it should not overshadow the trauma experienced by residents. Always prioritize respectful behavior and ensure your visit benefits the affected area.
