After disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, tourism played a complex role. While it brought economic benefits, it also caused resentment among locals still struggling to rebuild. Voluntourism, where visitors help with recovery efforts, can be a positive way to contribute. Always choose local accommodations and services to ensure your spending supports the community directly. Avoid disaster tours that exploit local suffering. Instead, engage in activities that genuinely help the affected area recover.
