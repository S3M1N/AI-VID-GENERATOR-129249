In Maui, after the 2023 wildfires, officials prioritized local needs before reopening to tourists. Clear communication and a locals-first approach helped balance recovery with tourism. Visitors were encouraged to support the community respectfully, avoiding devastated areas. The outpouring of global support was heartwarming. When visiting post-disaster areas, always stay informed, buy local, and be respectful. Tourism can aid recovery, but it must be balanced with the needs of the affected community. Prioritize people over economic activity to ensure a respectful and beneficial visit.
