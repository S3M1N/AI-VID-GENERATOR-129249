The Kilmartin Museum's foundation began in the early 1990s, and it now houses an extraordinary collection of artefacts, including vases, beaker pots, pottery, axe and arrowheads. The museum's exhibits highlight the fragile nature of human existence and the importance of honoring our ancestors' histories. Gaelic speakers have a proverb for digging into the past: 'Cuimhnich air na daoine on d√†naig u' (To remember those from whom you came). The museum and the glen together offer a unique journey through time, revealing the rich prehistoric heritage of Scotland.
