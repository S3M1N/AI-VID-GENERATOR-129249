The glen's archaeological wonders are tightly clustered within a six-mile radius of Kilmartin village. Sites like Kilmartin Glebe Cairn, Temple Wood Stone Circle, and Nether Largie South Cairn reveal ancient rituals and burial practices. The area also features rock art sites like Achnabreck, where carvings align with the midwinter sunset. These prehistoric carvings are believed to be alive with supernatural forces. The Kilmartin Museum, with its collection of 22,000 artefacts, helps contextualize these outdoor sites, making it a museum of place.
