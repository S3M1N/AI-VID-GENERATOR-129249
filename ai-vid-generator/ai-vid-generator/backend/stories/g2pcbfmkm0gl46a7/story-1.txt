Viche, a strong and sweet liquor from Colombia, is on the verge of becoming the country's national drink. Distilled by Afro-Colombians from various sugarcane types, it carries deep cultural significance, used in rituals from birth to death. Despite its growing popularity, viche faces challenges due to legal restrictions and cultural appropriation concerns. Bartenders are smuggling it overseas, highlighting its demand. The recent Law of Viche aims to protect this ancestral beverage, but regulatory hurdles remain. As viche gains recognition, the fight to preserve its heritage continues.
