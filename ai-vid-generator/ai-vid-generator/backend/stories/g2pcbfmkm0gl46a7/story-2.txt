Women play a crucial role in viche production, often passing down the craft through generations. The drink's unique flavors vary based on the region where the sugarcane is grown, making each batch distinct. Viche is not just a drink; it embodies the history and struggles of Afro-Colombian communities. The Petronio √Ålvarez Pacific Music Festival has helped popularize viche, allowing it to be the only alcohol served at the event. As demand rises, the community faces the risk of losing their heritage to commercial interests.
