The future of viche hinges on balancing tradition with modern demands. The government is working on a "viche route" to promote tourism and connect producers with consumers. However, the informal nature of viche production complicates regulatory efforts. As new brands emerge, the community must protect their ancestral knowledge from exploitation. The fight for viche is not just about a drink; it's about preserving a cultural legacy that has endured through generations. The journey of viche reflects the resilience and spirit of Afro-Colombian heritage.
