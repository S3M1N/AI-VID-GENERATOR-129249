Viche, a strong and sweet liquor from Colombia, is on the verge of becoming the country's national drink. Distilled by Afro-Colombians from various sugarcane types, it carries deep cultural significance, used in rituals from birth to death. Despite its growing popularity, viche faces challenges due to bureaucratic hurdles and cultural appropriation concerns. Bartenders are smuggling it overseas, highlighting its demand. Recent laws aim to protect viche's heritage, but regulatory issues remain. As the drink gains traction, the fight to preserve its cultural roots continues.
